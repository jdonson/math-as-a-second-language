MSL PROCESS FLOW 

0.  Structure MSL terminology database.

1.  Target Exam PDF File URL

	INPUTS:   	user targets xyz.pdf

	OUTPUTS:  	user, url, pdf file

2.  Catalog Targeted Exam

	INPUTS:   	user, url, pdf file (On Duplicate Key Update)

	OUTPUTS: 	file size, question count, exam date, etc  ("exam metadata")

3.  Extract all text from pdf file and provide ascii word list and images.

	INPUTS:		pdf file

	OUTPUTS:	ascii word list and images

4.  Report on word frequencies in ascii file, sorted by occurrence.

	INPUTS:		ascii word list

	OUTPUTS:	MSL terminology frequency report

5.  Extract all text from pdf file and populate terminology database with this content.

6.  Tag questions with 'question type' labels:  {linguistic|numeric}{tsm, pow, geo, alg, etc}

7.  With this word/problem opportunity, show how we can discuss micro-scenario:

	Two students on same exam on same day got same two math exam problems wrong.

	=> How can we show that high-frequency terms may be the reason for their errors?

	=> How would these students have performed with the equivalent calculation problem without the language burden?
